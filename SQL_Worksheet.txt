11. A data warehouse is a large collection of business data used to help an organization make decisions
 a data warehouse periodically pulls data from the apps and systems; then, the data goes through formatting and 
 import processes to match the data already in the warehouse. The data warehouse stores this processed data so itâ€™s ready for decision makers to access. 
 How frequently data pulls occur, or how data is formatted, etc., will vary depending on the needs of the organization.
 
 
 12. An OLTP system captures and maintains transaction data in a database. Each transaction involves individual database
 records made up of multiple fields or columns. Examples include banking and credit card activity or retail checkout scanning.
 
 OLAP applies complex queries to large amounts of historical data, aggregated from OLTP databases and other sources, for data mining, analytics, 
 and business intelligence projects. In OLAP, the emphasis is on response time to these complex queries.
 
 13. Integrated: The way data is extracted and transformed is uniform, regardless of the original source.
    Time-variant: Data is organized via time-periods (weekly, monthly, annually, etc.).
     Non-volatile: A data warehouse is not updated in real-time. It is periodically updated via the uploading of data, protecting it from the influence of momentary change.
	 
	 
14. The star schema is an important special case of the snowflake schema, and is more effective for handling simpler queries. 
The star schema gets its name from the physical model's resemblance to a 
star shape with a fact table at its center and the dimension tables surrounding it representing the star's points.
